# Recommendation System
This project implements a simple item recommendation system using JavaScript. The system is designed to recommend items based on their similarity to a given input item, as determined by a description-based similarity score.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

- `basic/item-recommender.js`: This file contains the basic implementation of the recommendation system. It includes the `ItemGlobal` and `ItemExtended` classes, which define the properties of an item, as well as the `calculateSimilarity` and `generateRecommendations` functions. The `generateRecommendations` function uses the `calculateSimilarity` function to recommend items that are similar to a given input item.
